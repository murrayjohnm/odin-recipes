# odin-recipes

This is a project to test my HTML knowledge as part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course.

I will build a basic recipe website.
There will be an index page with links to some recipes.
This will not feature any CSS at this time, but will be updated and styled in the future.

HELLO Dad!
